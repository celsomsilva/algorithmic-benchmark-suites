# Algorithmic Benchmark Suites

This repository is the central hub for a set of projects where I reimplemented classical algorithms in different programming languages and benchmarked them.
Each language version is its own repository.
This one exists to connect everything and provide context.

## What this project is really about

This is not about writing the fastest quicksort.

It’s about:

- implementing algorithms explicitly
- validating correctness with tests
- measuring performance properly
- and understanding how different languages shape the implementation

Some languages hide more.
Some expose more.
Both are interesting.

## The repositories

Each implementation lives in its own repository:

### Java

Engineering-focused version.
Object-oriented structure, Gradle build, JUnit tests, simple benchmarks.
https://github.com/celsomsilva/algorithmic-benchmark-suite-java

---

### R

Statistical and experimental perspective.
Uses testthat, microbenchmark, and reproducible reports.
https://github.com/celsomsilva/algorithmic-benchmark-suite-R

---

### Rust

Systems-level implementation.
Explicit ownership, predictable performance, and memory safety.
https://github.com/celsomsilva/algorithmic-benchmark-suite-rust

---

### Legacy Pascal and C

Original academic implementations from the early 2000s.
These are preserved as historical reference.
No cleanup. No modernization. Just the original code.
